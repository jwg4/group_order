 - give an example of a non-abelian group of order 2048
 - how many abelian groups?
 - how many isoclinism classes for smaller orders?
 - can we generate all elements of a group from the generator/commutator expression?
 - can we generate the next element of the lower central series?
 - how can we test for isoclinism?
